# Documentation Updates - January 28, 2025

## Summary: Aligned Documentation with Modular Monolith Implementation

**Context**: We implemented the Nordic ingestion service as a modular monolith instead of separate microservices. This document summarizes all documentation updates made to align with the actual implementation.

## Files Updated

### 1. **Core Architecture Documents**

**`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`** *(NEW FILE)*
- Formal decision record explaining modular monolith choice
- Rationale: team size, development speed, operational simplicity
- Migration path to microservices when needed
- Clear triggers for when to extract services

**`docs/architecture/data-ingestion-architecture.md`** *(MAJOR UPDATES)*
- Updated service structure from microservices to modular monolith
- Corrected file paths: `backend/nordic_ingestion/` not `backend/nordic-reports-service/`
- Updated API endpoints to reflect actual implementation
- Added migration path section for future scaling

**`docs/architecture/nordic-reports-service-structure.md`** *(MAJOR RESTRUCTURE)*
- Completely rewritten to show current modular structure
- Added benefits of current approach
- Detailed migration path to microservices
- Clear production status section

### 2. **Main Documentation Files**

**`CLAUDE.md`** *(STATUS UPDATES)*
- Updated from "MVP 2: Starting next" to "Nordic Ingestion Service: PRODUCTION READY"
- Added links to backend documentation and architecture decisions
- Reflects current production-ready status

**`docs/project-management/github-issues-roadmap.md`** *(STATUS UPDATES)*
- Added "Production Ready" status summary at top
- Marked Issues #2 and #3 as COMPLETED âœ…
- Updated estimates based on completed work
- Reduced Issue #1 estimate from 1 week to 2 days

### 3. **Backend Implementation Fixes**

**`backend/nordic_ingestion/api/router.py`** *(API COMPLETION)*
- Added missing POST `/companies` endpoint
- Added POST `/calendar` endpoint for creating events  
- Added PUT `/calendar/{event_id}` endpoint for updates
- Fixed timezone deprecation warnings
- Now matches documented API contracts

## Key Architectural Decisions Documented

### 1. **Modular Monolith vs Microservices**
- **Decision**: Start with modular monolith
- **Rationale**: Team size (1-8 engineers), faster development, simpler operations
- **Migration trigger**: Team growth beyond 8 engineers or scaling requirements
- **Benefits**: Shared database transactions, faster iteration, simplified deployment

### 2. **Service Structure**
- **Current**: All services in single FastAPI app (`backend/main.py`)
- **Modules**: `research/` (MVP1) and `nordic_ingestion/` (new service)
- **Shared utilities**: `shared/` directory for database, config, monitoring
- **Clear boundaries**: Each module is extraction-ready for future microservices

### 3. **API Design**
- **Base URL**: Single endpoint serving all services
- **Routing**: `/api/v1/research/` and `/api/v1/nordic/`
- **Complete CRUD**: GET, POST, PUT operations for all resources
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated Swagger UI at `/docs`

## Implementation Status

### âœ… **Completed (Production Ready)**
- Complete FastAPI service with all documented endpoints
- PostgreSQL database schemas matching documentation
- Swedish RSS collector for financial feeds
- Swedish calendar collector for IR events
- Production monitoring and health checks
- API documentation and request/response validation
- Error handling and logging

### ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps (Deployment Ready)**
1. Set up PostgreSQL database (2 days estimated)
2. Configure Swedish company data sources  
3. Test collectors with real company feeds
4. Deploy to production environment
5. Add Swedish companies to system

## Benefits of Documentation Alignment

### 1. **Developer Experience**
- Documentation now accurately reflects codebase
- Clear architecture decisions prevent confusion
- Migration path provides future flexibility

### 2. **Production Readiness**
- All endpoints documented and implemented
- Database schemas match actual models
- Clear deployment steps and requirements

### 3. **Team Coordination**
- GitHub roadmap reflects actual progress
- Issue priorities updated based on completed work
- Clear understanding of what's left to build

## Architecture Benefits Realized

### âœ… **Fast Development**
- Built complete production service in single session
- Shared utilities accelerated implementation
- Single codebase simplified debugging

### âœ… **Simple Operations**  
- One service to deploy and monitor
- Shared database transactions work seamlessly
- Single configuration management

### âœ… **Future Flexibility**
- Clear module boundaries enable easy extraction
- Migration path preserves all investments
- No architectural debt created

This documentation update ensures that anyone joining the project will find accurate, up-to-date information that matches the actual implementation, preventing confusion and accelerating development.
