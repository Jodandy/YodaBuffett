# YodaBuffett - Security Architecture

## Security-First Design Principles

### Zero Trust Architecture
- [ ] Never trust, always verify
- [ ] Least privilege access control
- [ ] Assume breach mentality
- [ ] Continuous security validation

### Defense in Depth
- [ ] Multiple security layers
- [ ] Fail-safe security controls
- [ ] Security monitoring at all levels
- [ ] Automated threat response

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- [ ] OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration
- [ ] JWT token management
- [ ] Session management security
- [ ] Password policy enforcement

### Service-to-Service Authentication
- [ ] Service mesh security (mTLS)
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] Certificate-based authentication
- [ ] Token rotation policies

### Authorization Model
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- [ ] Fine-grained permissions
- [ ] Resource-level authorization

## API Security

### API Gateway Security
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/IP
- [ ] DDoS protection
- [ ] Request size limitations
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] API versioning security

### GraphQL Security
- [ ] Query depth limiting
- [ ] Query complexity analysis
- [ ] Introspection disabling in production
- [ ] Query allowlisting
- [ ] Field-level authorization

### REST API Security
- [ ] HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.3)

- [ ] NoSQL injection prevention

## Data Security

### Encryption Standards
- [ ] Data at rest: AES-256 encryption
- [ ] Data in transit: TLS 1.3
- [ ] Database encryption (Transparent Data Encryption)
- [ ] File storage encryption
- [ ] Key management service (KMS)

### Data Classification
- [ ] Public data
- [ ] Internal data
- [ ] Confidential data (PII)
- [ ] Restricted data (financial)
- [ ] Data handling procedures

### Privacy Protection
- [ ] PII identification and masking
- [ ] Data anonymization techniques
- [ ] Right to deletion (GDPR)
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Cross-border data transfer controls

## LLM Security

### Prompt Injection Prevention
- [ ] Input sanitization for LLM queries
- [ ] Output filtering and validation
- [ ] Context isolation
- [ ] Prompt template security
- [ ] Jailbreak detection

### Data Exposure Prevention
- [ ] PII detection in LLM inputs/outputs
- [ ] Sensitive data redaction
- [ ] Query logging and monitoring
- [ ] Model response filtering

## Infrastructure Security

### Container Security
- [ ] Base image vulnerability scanning
