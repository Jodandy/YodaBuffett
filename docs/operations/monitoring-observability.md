# YodaBuffett - Monitoring & Observability

## Observability Strategy

### Three Pillars of Observability
- [ ] **Metrics**: Quantitative data about system performance

- [ ] Reduce mean time to detection (MTTD)
- [ ] Minimize mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- [ ] Understand user behavior patterns
- [ ] Optimize system performance
