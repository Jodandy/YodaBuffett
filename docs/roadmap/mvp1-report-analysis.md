## LLM Prompt Engineering

### Core Analysis Prompt Structure
```
You are a senior financial analyst. Analyze the following SEC filing section and provide insights on [ANALYSIS_TYPE].

Document Context:
- Company: [COMPANY_NAME]
- Filing Type: [10-K/10-Q/8-K]
- Filing Date: [DATE]
- Section: [MD&A/Risk Factors/etc.]

Text to Analyze:
[DOCUMENT_SECTION]

Please provide:
1. Key insights (3-5 bullet points)
2. Supporting evidence with page references
3. Confidence level (High/Medium/Low) for each insight
4. Potential implications for investors
5. Areas requiring further investigation

Format your response as structured JSON.
```

### Prompt Variations to Test
- [ ] **Conservative Analysis**: Focus on risks and challenges
- [ ] **Growth-Oriented**: Emphasize opportunities and positive developments
- [ ] **Quantitative Focus**: Emphasize numbers, ratios, and financial metrics
- [ ] **Qualitative Focus**: Emphasize strategy, management, and market dynamics

## Testing Strategy

### Test Documents
- [ ] **Apple 10-K** (large tech company)
- [ ] **Small biotech 10-Q** (high-risk growth company) 
- [ ] **Bank 10-K** (regulated financial services)
- [ ] **REIT 10-K** (real estate investment trust)
- [ ] **Retail company 10-Q** (consumer discretionary)

### Validation Methods
- [ ] **Human Analyst Comparison**: Compare AI insights to professional analyst reports
- [ ] **Time-to-Insight Measurement**: How long would human take vs AI?
- [ ] **Insight Quality Scoring**: Rate usefulness and accuracy of insights
- [ ] **Coverage Analysis**: What percentage of important points did AI catch?

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- [ ] **Processing Speed**: < 2 minutes for typical 10-K filing
- [ ] **Insight Coverage**: AI identifies 80%+ of key points human analysts find
- [ ] **Accuracy Rate**: 90%+ of AI insights are factually correct
- [ ] **Cost Efficiency**: < $5 LLM cost per comprehensive analysis

### Qualitative Metrics
- [ ] **Insight Quality**: Insights provide actionable intelligence
- [ ] **Novelty**: AI discovers non-obvious connections and patterns
- [ ] **Usability**: Non-expert users can understand and act on analysis
- [ ] **Trust**: Users feel confident in AI-generated insights
