## 🔑 Key Decisions

### Build vs Buy
**Build**: Basic scraping for public data
**Buy**: Premium data APIs only when necessary

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for real-time prices (5-minute TTL)
- PostgreSQL for historical data
- CDN for static content

### Legal Compliance
- Respect robots.txt
- Add delays between requests
- Use official APIs when available
- No credential sharing/bypassing

## 💡 Future Extensions
- Options chain data
- Insider trading feeds
- Economic indicators
- Social media sentiment
- International market data
