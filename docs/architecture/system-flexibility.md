# YodaBuffett - System Flexibility & Change Management

## Overview
How the platform adapts to changing requirements, technology, and business needs.

## Contract-Based Architecture

### API Contracts
- [ ] Define versioning strategy (v1, v2, etc.)
- [ ] Implement contract testing framework
- [ ] Create backward compatibility guidelines
- [ ] Set up contract validation in CI/CD

### Database Abstraction Layer
- [ ] Implement repository pattern for all data access
- [ ] Create database migration framework
- [ ] Design zero-downtime deployment strategy
- [ ] Plan for database provider switching (PostgreSQL â†’ MongoDB, etc.)

### Storage Provider Abstraction
- [ ] Create storage interface (local, S3, GCS, Azure)
- [ ] Implement provider factory pattern
- [ ] Plan data migration between providers
- [ ] Design cost optimization strategies

## Flexibility Points

### LLM Provider Switching
- [ ] Create LLM provider interface
- [ ] Implement OpenAI, Anthropic, local model adapters
- [ ] Design cost optimization routing
- [ ] Plan for model version updates

### Vector Database Flexibility
- [ ] Abstract vector operations (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant)
- [ ] Design embedding migration strategy
- [ ] Plan for vector dimension changes
- [ ] Implement performance comparison tools

### Queue System Flexibility
- [ ] Create event bus abstraction
- [ ] Support Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, cloud queues
- [ ] Design message serialization standards
- [ ] Plan for queue provider migration

## Migration Strategies

### Database Migrations
- [ ] Version controlled schema changes
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed migrations
- [ ] Data transformation scripts
- [ ] Performance impact testing

### Zero-Downtime Deployments
- [ ] Blue-green deployment setup
- [ ] Feature flag implementation
- [ ] Database expansion patterns
- [ ] Dual-write strategies during transitions

## Configuration Management
- [ ] Environment-based configuration
- [ ] Feature flag management system
- [ ] Runtime configuration updates
- [ ] Configuration validation

## Change Scenarios & Solutions
- [ ] Document common change patterns
- [ ] Create change impact assessment tools
- [ ] Build automated testing for migrations
- [ ] Design rollback procedures

## Testing for Flexibility
- [ ] Provider-agnostic test suites
- [ ] Contract compliance testing
- [ ] Migration testing framework
- [ ] Performance regression testing
