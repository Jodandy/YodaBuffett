# YodaBuffett - Architecture Limitations & Mitigation

## Known Bottlenecks & Solutions

### Real-Time Data Bottlenecks
**Problem**: Event-driven architecture may struggle with high-frequency market data
- [ ] Implement separate "hot path" for real-time data (Kafka/Pulsar)
- [ ] Design bypass mechanism for event sourcing with tick data
- [ ] Evaluate specialized time-series databases (QuestDB, InfluxDB)
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for different data volumes

### Complex Graph Queries
**Problem**: Current architecture optimized for documents, not relationships
- [ ] Add graph database module (Neo4j, ArangoDB)
- [ ] Design GraphQL federation for complex queries
- [ ] Create materialized views for common relationship patterns
- [ ] Plan for hybrid SQL + graph queries

### Cost Explosion at Scale
**Problem**: LLM costs can spiral out of control
- [ ] Implement aggressive caching with semantic similarity
- [ ] Create local LLM fallback system
- [ ] Design cost budgets per user/query type
- [ ] Build query complexity scoring system
- [ ] Create cost monitoring and alerting

### Data Consistency Challenges
**Problem**: Financial data requires strong consistency
- [ ] Design two-tier consistency system
- [ ] Implement versioned data with point-in-time queries
- [ ] Create saga pattern for distributed transactions
- [ ] Plan for regulatory correction propagation

### Debugging Event-Sourced Systems
**Problem**: Hard to debug when state is derived from events
- [ ] Create periodic snapshots for faster rebuilds
- [ ] Build event visualization tools
- [ ] Implement debug mode with event tracing
- [ ] Design compensating event patterns

### Plugin Version Hell
**Problem**: Multiple analysis modules with conflicting dependencies
- [ ] Containerize modules with isolated dependencies
- [ ] Enforce semantic versioning

### Performance Degradation
**Problem**: Pure functional approach creates overhead
- [ ] Implement structural sharing for immutable data
- [ ] Design lazy evaluation strategies
- [ ] Create performance escape hatches with isolation
- [ ] Evaluate Rust/C++ for hot paths

### Compliance & Audit Challenges
**Problem**: Flexible architecture makes compliance hard
- [ ] Create compliance wrapper for all operations
- [ ] Implement encrypted events with key deletion (GDPR)
- [ ] Build automated compliance testing
- [ ] Plan region-specific deployments

### Storage Cost Explosion
**Problem**: Event sourcing + immutability = massive storage
- [ ] Design event archival strategies (cold storage)
- [ ] Create compact snapshots for old data
- [ ] Implement differential storage for versions
- [ ] Research embedding compression techniques

### Query Complexity Explosion
**Problem**: Natural language allows infinitely complex queries
- [ ] Build query complexity scoring
- [ ] Implement resource limits per query
- [ ] Create query plan explanation
- [ ] Design simpler alternative suggestions

### Cache Invalidation Nightmares
**Problem**: Complex caching with multiple data sources
- [ ] Design time-based + event-based invalidation
- [ ] Create cache dependency graphs
- [ ] Implement generation numbers for cache versions
- [ ] Build background cache warming

### Testing Complexity
**Problem**: Testing AI + financial systems is hard
- [ ] Create deterministic LLM mode for tests
- [ ] Build frozen test datasets
- [ ] Implement property-based testing
