🏛️ FINANSINSPEKTIONEN INTEGRATION STRATEGY

📋 PHASE 1: Manual Testing (Week 1)
- Visit https://finanscentralen.fi.se/search/SearchByRegistrationDate.aspx  
- Test different date ranges and search types
- Document result format and PDF access
- Understand filing patterns (when do companies report?)
- Manual collection of 10-20 recent reports

📋 PHASE 2: Automated Monitoring (Week 2-3)  
- Daily automated search for "yesterday's filings"
- Parse HTML results for company names and document types
- Filter for quarterly/annual reports only
- Generate notification list for download orchestrator
- Maintain database of filing dates vs. report types

📋 PHASE 3: Integration (Week 4)
- Connect FI search with download orchestrator
- Automatic PDF download when new reports found
- Smart classification (Q1/Q2/Q3/Annual detection)
- Historical analysis to predict future filing dates
- Dashboard showing "New reports today: 5 companies"

🎯 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

def search_fi_daily():
    yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)
    search_params = {
        'from_date': yesterday.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'to_date': yesterday.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'document_type': 'quarterly_reports'
    }
    
    results = submit_fi_search(search_params)
    new_reports = parse_fi_results(results)
    
    for report in new_reports:
        orchestrator.add_task(
            company=report.company_name,
            report_type=report.report_type,  
            year=report.year,
            direct_pdf_url=report.pdf_url,
            source="finansinspektionen",
            priority="high"  # Official filings = high priority
        )

📊 EXPECTED RESULTS:
- 100% coverage of Swedish public companies
- Real-time notifications (same day as filing)
- Zero legal complications 
- Single source of truth for all Swedish corporate reporting
- Automatic integration with existing download pipeline

⚖️ LEGAL CONFIDENCE: 
This is the ONLY 100% legally bulletproof approach.
Government agencies in Sweden are required to provide 
public access to all filed documents under 
Offentlighetsprincipen (Freedom of Information Act).

🎉 This could be the breakthrough that makes 
YodaBuffett the definitive Swedish corporate intelligence platform!
