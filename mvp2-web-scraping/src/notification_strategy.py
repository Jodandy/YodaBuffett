🔄 HYBRID NOTIFICATION SYSTEM

📋 TIER 1 - Automatic (High Confidence)
- RSS feeds for companies that have them (Volvo, etc.)
- Company IR calendar scraping (monthly)
- Email newsletter parsing
- → Direct integration with download orchestrator

📋 TIER 2 - Estimated (Medium Confidence)  
- Historical pattern modeling
- Quarterly date predictions
- Industry standard timing
- → Proactive alerts 1 week before expected date

📋 TIER 3 - Manual Monitoring (Backup)
- Weekly manual check of key companies
- Social media alerts for major announcements
- Manual calendar updates
- → Human oversight for edge cases

🎯 SMART ALERTS:
Week -2: "Volvo Q3 expected in 2 weeks (estimated)"
Week -1: "Volvo Q3 expected this week - check IR page"
Day 0:   "Volvo Q3 published! Auto-download starting..."
Day +1:  "Volvo Q3 failed auto-download - manual queue"

📊 COVERAGE ESTIMATE:
- Tier 1 (Automatic): ~30% of Swedish companies
- Tier 2 (Estimated): ~90% of Swedish companies  
- Tier 3 (Manual): 100% coverage

⏱️ MAINTENANCE:
- Daily: RSS monitoring (automated)
- Weekly: Manual verification of estimates
- Monthly: Update historical patterns
- Quarterly: Review and improve predictions

🎯 This gives you 90% automation with 100% coverage!
