### Dear Spotlight Team,

I'm building **YodaBuffett**, an AI-powered financial research platform focused on Swedish companies, including many listed on Spotlight Stock Market.

#### What We're Building
- **Academic research tool** for analyzing Swedish financial reports
- **AI-assisted analysis** of quarterly and annual reports
- **Focus on smaller/emerging companies** (Spotlight's specialty)
- **Non-commercial research platform** for institutional analysis

#### What We Need
- **Automated access** to your report calendar (https://spotlightstockmarket.com/sv/market-overview/rapportkalender/)
- **Once daily check** for new report publication dates
- **Respectful scraping** (1 request/day, proper User-Agent, delays)
- **Attribution** to Spotlight as data source in our platform

#### What You Get
- **Increased visibility** for Spotlight-listed companies
- **Professional analysis coverage** for smaller companies (often overlooked)
- **Academic research citations** enhancing market credibility
- **Traffic referrals** when users click through to company pages

#### Technical Details
- **Minimal server load** (1 request per day)
- **Proper identification** (clear User-Agent string)
- **No competitive use** (we're building analysis tools, not a competing exchange)
- **Data transformation** (we process reports, don't redistribute raw calendar data)

#### Legal Compliance
- We respect all copyright and intellectual property rights
- Data used only for legitimate financial research purposes
- No redistribution of Spotlight's proprietary content
- Full attribution to Spotlight Stock Market as original source

Would you be open to discussing this partnership? I believe there's strong mutual benefit in making Spotlight companies more accessible to institutional research.

I'm happy to provide more details about our platform, sign any necessary agreements, or adjust our approach based on your preferences.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
YodaBuffett Research Platform

### Follow-up if No Response

**Week 2 Follow-up:**
"Following up on my previous email about research platform access. Would a brief call work better to discuss this partnership opportunity?"

**Week 4 Final:**
"I understand you may be busy. If automated access isn't possible, I'm happy to work within any guidelines you prefer for occasional manual research of your report calendar."

### Alternative: Conservative Approach

If no response after 4 weeks:
- **Manual monitoring only** (weekly manual checks)
- **Screenshot documentation** of any data used
- **Clear attribution** in all research outputs
- **Professional use** (research/academic context)

This conservative approach has strong legal backing:
- **Public financial data** (regulatory requirement)
- **Fair use for research** (well-established legal principle)  
- **No commercial competition** with Spotlight's business
- **Minimal server impact** (weekly manual access)
