# YodaBuffett - AI-Powered Investment Research Platform

**ðŸš€ For complete architecture details, see [CLAUDE-MASTER.md](./CLAUDE-MASTER.md)**

## Quick Context
Extensible platform for institutional-grade financial research. AI-assisted analysis, predictive modeling, and advanced backtesting capabilities.

## Architecture at a Glance
- **Microservices**: API Gateway, Research, Data Ingestion, Strategy, Prediction, User services
- **Stack**: Python (AI/ML), TypeScript/Node.js (APIs), PostgreSQL + Vector DB
- **AI**: Research acceleration, data analysis, ensemble predictions

## Current Focus
Building extensible platform for any financial analysis, not just specific features.

## Current Development Focus
ðŸ”¬ **MVP 1: AI-Powered Report Analysis** - Building proof-of-concept for LLM-based financial document analysis

See: [Development Roadmap](./docs/roadmap/README.md) | [Current MVP Details](./docs/roadmap/mvp1-report-analysis.md)
